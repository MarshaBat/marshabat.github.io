  <h3>Quantitative Accomplishments</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Just recently at my prior place of employment, I designed and developed a 40-hour course to teach medical assistants an organization’s policies and standard practice procedures concerning medication administration. At the time of my departure, I had taught 25 students.</li>
			<li>I’ve completed the beta version of an electronic health record (EHR), with the help of a contracted developer, designed to provide forensic nurses and other medical forensic practitioners the tools they need to better document and care for survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence.</li>
			<li>I’ve recommitted to my personal blog focused on career-building strategies, self-care and lifestyle design for nurses. In the 6 weeks, I have posted a blog entry weekly.</li>
		</ul>
  
   <h3>Quantitative Features</h3>
   	<ul>
   	<li><strong>Visionary</strong> - I excel at creating an overall vision and can identify solutions to help solve problems. I am a big-picture, out-of-the-box thinker that can outline different avenues to complete a task. Although I inherently know the flow and how projects should be executed, I enjoy overseeing a project rather than take on the individual tasks.</li>
		<li><strong>Independent</strong> - I work well independently, and with that space, can achieve much more quality work as opposed to working in teams. Little supervision and the allowance of creativity will go a long way.</li>
		<li><strong>Compassionate</strong> - I am dedicated to the work that I care deeply about. I am able to empathize with people from any background and any circumstance. I believe in asking why and about whom a project will help and/or hurt.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Whole Brain Paragraph</h3>
		<p>As a web developer, I have an overall mission to empower survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence take control of their reporting and healing process by equiping them and the forensic, medical, legal and advocate support professional community with innovative web and mobile technologies.</p>
		<p>I focus on the mental, physical and emotional needs of survivors. And, appreciating a vision through a survivor’s eyes can help me (and others who may be involved) know where to keep my focus.</p>
		<p>I generally like to focus on the big picture and the major problems surrounding survivor care. I then look to ways that I and others on my team can achieve solutions. I enjoy breaking down a vision into smaller, manageable goals. I then make a plan of the who, what, when where and how I get those goals accomplished and commit to a timeline.</p>

   <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
        <h4>Version 1</h4>
				<p>Hi, I’m Marsha. I design and develop bold, innovative technology solutions to help survivor support agencies reach out and engage with their clients during their reporting and healing process.</p>

  	<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		  <h3>Week1</h3>
		  		<p>I enjoyed the first week of the Fullstack coding camp, although I was surprised by the content. I envisioned all intensive camps to focus on coding challenges all day from 8 to 5 since there would be so much content to learn. I thought there would be very few breaks in between intense hours of code, however I am thrilled that pace is not the case.</p>
				<p>I found the instructors and Deep Dive staff to be concerned and caring about keeping us on track and emphasizing that there is help if we ask for it. I also appreciate the different teaching styles and the various ways the content was presented. I feel more at ease after the week ended and look forward to the progress I’ll make.</p>
